<h3><p align="center">My second creative project created for college. You'll have to answer questions in a limited amount of time.</p></h3> 
<h3><p align="center">It's an updated version of the old game version. Updated code, graphics, sounds and test system. The old version may be released later (not sure :P).</p></h3>

## How to convert test to exe

To create a standalone application, you need to install Python 3.11 or newer.<br>
Next, install the PyInstaller module in `cmd`:

```batch
pip install pyinstaller
```

The PyInstaller module is used to convert the project into an executable `.exe` file.
  
Run the batch file `test_to_exe.bat` to start the conversion.<br>
A `NewTest` folder will be created in the project folder with the converted project into an `.exe` file.
